# Kuiper-Belt-Website
This website is a responsive site using information pulled from and linked to NASA.gov

It was coded using CSS and HTML for WEB 122 at Johnson County Community College as part of an AAS in Web Development.
This was my first introduction to using an animated hamburger menu for responsive design, which I found on CodePen and adapted to work with my project. The images were downloaded from Unsplash and the topic was based on personal interest. The design and style guide were based on colors that invoked outer space and a simple hard coded SVG was used as the logo.
