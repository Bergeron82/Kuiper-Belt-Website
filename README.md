# Kuiper-Belt-Website
This website is a responsive site using information pulled from and linked to NASA.gov

It was coded using CSS and HTML for WEB 122 at Johnson County Community College as part of an AAS in Web Development.
This was my first introduction to using an animated hamburger menu for responsive design, which I found on CodePen and adapted to work with my project. The images were all downloaded from Unsplash and the topic was based on personal interest. I based the design and style guide on colors that went with the idea of outer space and used a simple hard coded SVG as the logo.
